# FlutterChat
A chatting application built on Flutter and Firebase. 

## Introduction
Flutter is a develpment kit created by google using which you can build apps for android and ios. You can use it to build web apps as well. I have started this project as a part of practice in my flutter journy and built alot of features.

## Technologies you need
- If you know flutter and dart you are good to go but if you don't know and have other programming languages background or no programming background you can still work on it by following some [tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTju8w4zEno&list=PLBxWkM8PLHcr2vkdY2n9rIcxjZ9Th3Us7) and [docs](https://flutter.dev/docs).

- Working with firebase database and storage is not a big deal follow the official [docs](https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/firestore/usage/).

## Getting started
In order to get started you need to have few setups ready.
1) Android studio with flutter installed. You can follow this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDnqXmLSqtg&t=13s) for installation.
2) If you want to work on vs code that's also fine follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5izFFbdHnWY).
3) An android emulator or real android device, you can run your app in chrome or edge as well but it is slow.
